## Generators


### Scaffold

Builds out a full app scaffold with client & server

#### Tasks

| Command                   | Description                                  |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `grunt default`           | Starts the app in development mode           |
| `grunt build`             | Builds out a production version of the app   |
| `grunt build:development` | Builds out static files without minification |
| `grunt test`              | Runs all tests                               |
| `grunt testing`           | Starts the testing environment               |


### Client

A generator for a simple static client that queries apis for dynamic data.


#### Features

- Integrated deployment to S3 Cloudfront with [s3_website](https://github.com/laurilehmijoki/s3_website)
- Hashing of asset filenames to allow for aggressive caching
- asset management and bundling with [file-loader](https://github.com/webpack/file-loader)
- Prerending of react jsx to HTML for super quick loading with [static-site-generator-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/markdalgleish/static-site-generator-webpack-plugin)
- Testing with [ava](https://github.com/avajs/ava)
- Test coverage with [nyc](https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc)
- docs with [jsdonk](https://github.com/dxinteractive/jsdonk)
- Bundling with babel and webpack

#### Getting started

The generator will run `yarn install` and `yarn run build-dev` for you. `yarn run build-dev` will create the necessary html files to run the app locally.

To start developing, run the watch command:

```
yarn watch
```

This will start webpack-dev-server at the port you specified in the setup.

### Serverless [Î»]

A generator for serverless services.

#### Features

- Uses [serverless](http://serverless.com/) to manage lambda functions
- Has [serverless-offline](https://github.com/dherault/serverless-offline) for local development
- Custom bundler script to ensure that only required files are deployed to lambda
- Uses local version of serverless so that it doesn't have to be installed globally and for reproduceable builds across multiple enviroments.
- Babel transpilation so you can do fun es2015 stuff.
- Testing with [ava](https://github.com/avajs/ava)
- Test coverage with [nyc](https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc)
